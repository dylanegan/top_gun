I'd say it was the right time
To walk away
When dreaming takes you nowhere
It's time to play
Bodies working overtime
Your money don't matter
Time keeps ticking
Someone's on my mind (on my mind)

I'm moving in slow motion
Feels so good
It's a strange anticipation
Knock, knock, knocking on wood
Bodies working overtime
It's Man against man
All that ever matters
Is baby who's ahead in the game
Funny but it's always the same

Playing, playing with the boys
Staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys

She said it was the wrong thing
For me to do
I said it's just a boys' game
That Girls play too
My heart is working overtime
In this kind of game
People get hurt
I'm thinkin that the people is me
If you want to find me, I'll be

Playing, playing with the boys
Staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
...is the boys

I don't want to be the moth around your fire
...with the boys
I don't want to be obsessed by my desire
Your shining, Your smiling
I've seen enough
...with the boys
I'm staying here
You play too rough

Playing, playing with the boys
I'll be staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys
Playing with the boys
Playing
Playing
Playing
Playing
